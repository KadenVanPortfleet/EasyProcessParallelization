# Easy Abstract Process Parallelization
This repository primarily serves as a reminder for myself on how parallelize single application tasks that are highly abstract. I like this method as it is short and clean to implement. Not at all impressive but is useful.

The primary benefit of this is that the code is defined and ran arbitrarily without needing to define an object for the thread, allowing one to call it without having to inititialize it.
